Homework for RS School Machine Learning course.
===============================================

This demo uses [**Forest Cover Type Prediction**](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/forest-cover-type-prediction) dataset.

Usage
-----
This package allows you to train model.


1. Clone this repository to your machine.

2. Download [Forest Cover Type Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/forest-cover-type-prediction) dataset, save csv locally (default path is *data/train.csv* in repository's root).

3. Make sure Python 3.9 and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) are installed on your machine (I use Poetry 1.1.13).

4. Install the project dependencies (*run this and following commands in a terminal, from the root of a cloned repository*):

```
poetry install --no-dev
```

5. Run train with the following command:

```
poetry run train -d <path to csv with data> -s <path to save trained model>
```

You can configure additional options (such as hyperparameters) in the CLI. To get a full list of them, use help:

```
poetry run train --help
```

6. Run MLflow UI to see the information about experiments you conducted:

```
poetry run mlflow ui
```

Development
-----------

The code in this repository must be tested, formatted with black, and pass mypy typechecking before being commited to the repository.

* Install all requirements (including dev requirements) to poetry environment:

```
poetry install
```

* Now you can use developer instruments, e.g. pytest:

```
poetry run pytest
```
